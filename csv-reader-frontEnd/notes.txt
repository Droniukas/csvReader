/* mistakes:
    ☼ code is too procedural
    ☼ "renderAll" and "createTextArea" function too long
    ☼ there are repeating initilizations of variables, mostly of html 
    elements like "document.getElementById.."
*/

/* takeaways:
    ☼ async and promises can prevent alot of issues
*/



Don't pay attention to the commented out "displayRowsAddedPopUp();" code, it doesn't work how intended
